The Bus Observatory is a repository of big, streaming, urban transit data for non-commercial scientific and educational use.
# Available Data
## New York City Transit
We collect two feeds from the MTA Bus Time Developer API.
### **SIRI VehicleMonitoring**
>*System ID*: `nyct_mta_bus_siri`

> *Date Coverage:*
October 16, 2020 through present. This represents nearly 2 years' worth of vehicle movements on one of the world's largest urban bus systems.

>*Schema:* The [SIRI VehicleMonitoring feed](https://bustime.mta.info/wiki/Developers/SIRIVehicleMonitoring) is a complex, data-rich feed. We parse 23 fields, but also keep the full JSON responses (these can be made available on request).

### **GTFS-RT Positions**
> *System ID*: `nyct_mta_bus_gtfsrt`

> *Date Coverage:*
May 15, 2020 through present, once per minute.

> *Schema*
The MTA also provides vehicle positions through its [GTFS-RT feed](https://bustime.mta.info/wiki/Developers/GTFSRt). We parse all fields in this feed.

```
id                  	    string

vehicle.vehicle.id  	    string 
```

## NJTransit
NJTransit provides an unofficial open API operated by Clever Devices. We built on work by Chicago's civic hacking community, and fetch positions for the entire statewide bus system.
### **Clever Devices Unofficial API**
> *System ID*: `njtransit_bus`

> *Date Coverage & Frequency:*
April 5, 2021 through present, once per minute.

> *Schema*
This feed is based on an old technology and returns an XML response. We parse most of the fields in this feed, but most of them are undocumented.

### Where's My Bus System?

Over the next year, we plan to continue adding bus systems. Our focus will be on those supporting feed types we already are familiar with, including GTFS-RT, SIRI, and Clever Devices. Please use this form to suggest data feeds.

# Retrieving Data

## Obtaining an API Key

Lores mumps dolor sit mate, nominal id xiv. Dec ore offend it man re, est no dolor es explicate, re dicta elect ram demo critic duo. Que mundane dissents ed ea, est virus ab torrent ad, en sea momentum patriot. Erato dolor em omit tam quo no, per leg ere argument um re. Romanesque acclimates investiture.
## Endpoints

### Bulk Data Retrieval
The simplest and preferred method for data retrieval is the bulk data endpoint that provides positions for a single route for a single hour:

```
https://api.buswatcher.org/buses/bulk/{system_id}/{route}/{year}/{month}/{day}/{hour}/{apikey}
```
For example, to get all of the positions recorded from the New York City MTA Buses SIRI feed between 9pm and 10pm on July 4, 2022.

```
https://api.buswatcher.org/buses/bypath/nyct_mta_bus_siri/M1/2022/7/4/4/sfsafasfasf
```
Those who want to retrieve more route-hour bulk data sets are encouraging to develop their own programmatic approaches to requesting hour sequences or multiple routes. For instance:

```
TK Write a simple python grabber for one day.
buses = []
url=f"https://api.buswatcher.org/buses/bulk/nyct_mta_bus_siri/M1/2022/7/4/{hour}/sfsafasfasf"
for hour in range(0:23):
    buses.append(requests.get(url(hour).content))
```

### Direct Query
We are experimenting with a more powerful tool that allows queries by arbitrary arguments. Minimum required parameters are `system_id`, `route`, `start` and `end`â€”with the latter two timestamps in ISO8601 format. Start times are included in the query, end times are less than constrained.

For example, to get all of the positions recorded from the New York City MTA Buses SIRI feed all day on July 4, 2022:

```
https://api.buswatcher.org/buses/query/?system_id="nyct_mta_bus_siri"&route="M1"&start="2022-07-04T00:00:00"&end="2022-07-05T00:00:00"
```
